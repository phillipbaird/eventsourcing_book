## Chapter Notes

These notes are intended to highlight some of the differences between this and the [reference implementation](https://github.com/dilgerma/eventsourcing-book).

This implementation revolves around the [Disintegrate crate](https://github.com/disintegrate-es/disintegrate). A Rust library that provides an event store on top of a Postgresql database. I would highly recommend browsing [the docs](https://disintegrate-es.github.io/disintegrate/) to understand the differences between this library and aggregate centric solutions.

### Chapter 21 - AddItem

In this implementation, each slice is implemented in it's own source file in [`/src/domain/cart`](https://github.com/phillipbaird/eventsourcing_book/tree/main/src/domain/cart). The Add Item slice can be found [here](https://github.com/phillipbaird/eventsourcing_book/blob/main/src/domain/cart/add_item.rs).

Starting at the web api, the AddItemPayload is converted to an AddItemCommand. The command represents a decision that needs to be made. This decision is passed to the `DiscisionMaker` to make that decision. This either results in an error or one or more events being appended to the event store.

AddItemCommand is a simple struct that implements the Decision trait (like an interface). The `process` method implementation is responsible for validating the command and either returning an error or one or more events. The `process` method is supplied with some state which is used to validate the command. This state is derived from past events in the event store. One way to think about the state is it's like a micro-aggregate which only cares about the needs of this command.

The state for the command is implemented by a struct named AddItemState. It just identifies if the cart exists and how many items it holds. Later in chapter 27, a boolean flag was added to indicate if the cart has been submitted.

Which events are used to derive the state of the cart is controlled by a state query. In this case a derive macro has been used to automatically generate the query from the CartStream. The attribute `#[state_query(CartStream)]` identifies the stream and the `#[id]` field attribute identifies that we are only interested in events that match the cart id loaded into the AddItemState struct.

For a better introduction to what is happening here I'd recommend reading the Disintegrate explanation of [Decisions](https://disintegrate-es.github.io/disintegrate/decision).

At the end of the [`/src/domain/cart/add_item.rs`](https://github.com/phillipbaird/eventsourcing_book/blob/main/src/domain/cart/add_item.rs) file you will find the unit tests in a Given-When-Then format.

### Chapter 22 - Live Projections

A live projection is implemented in [`/src/domain/cart/cart_items.rs`](https://github.com/phillipbaird/eventsourcing_book/blob/main/src/domain/cart/cart_items.rs). The [`cart_items_read_model` function](https://github.com/phillipbaird/eventsourcing_book/blob/7afdbc5c098beb6ca18f8330b66bd8ad7dabcb81/src/domain/cart/cart_items.rs#L63-L69) does two things. First it creates an event query that will return the events needed for the read model. It then calls a helper function `read_from_events` which reads the events from the event store and does a left-fold to produce the read model. Note in this case we are returning the read model wrapped in an Option type. An Option type has two variants Some and None which allow us to indicate if the cart was found. The function named `apply_event` is our fold function. It takes a read model that acts as an accumulator and an event and returns a new read model.

There are two styles of test shown. The first takes a Given-Then approach which simply validates the fold function used to produce the read model. The second test processes commands and then produces the read model from the events that were produced. Note the `#[sqlx::test]` annotation provides our test with a connection pool to a clean database. Nice. Some folks might think that because we're writing to a database this should be an integration test. I'd agree if this was slow, but it runs in milliseconds so I've kept it as a unit test.

### Chapter 23 - Remove Item & Clear Cart

Both the [Remove Item](https://github.com/phillipbaird/eventsourcing_book/blob/main/src/domain/cart/remove_item.rs) and [Clear Cart](https://github.com/phillipbaird/eventsourcing_book/blob/main/src/domain/cart/clear_cart.rs) slices are very similar to the Add Item slice. See the Add Item notes above to get an idea of what is happening in this implementation.

### Chapter 24 - Change Inventory

The Change Inventory slice in [`/src/domain/cart/change_inventory.rs`](https://github.com/phillipbaird/eventsourcing_book/blob/main/src/domain/cart/change_inventory.rs) implements the InventoryChangedTranslator processor as a KafkaMessageHandler for the "inventories" topic. It translates the Kafka message to a ChangeInventoryCommand which is then processed.

The ChangeInventoryCommand is a little different as it has no validation associated with it and it's only purpose is to create a domain event. In cases like this where a command has no validation the Disintegrate crate allows us to forgo processing a command and we can simply append an event to the event store using the [`append_without_validation` method](https://docs.rs/disintegrate/latest/disintegrate/trait.EventStore.html#tymethod.append_without_validation). However, I decided to stay aligned with the book and stick with the Command-Event pattern. The Disintegrate crate assumes that processing a commend requires some state to validate against. There is no state needed in this case so some dummy state was created using an EmptyStream with an EmptyEvent. See the code comments in the [`stateless` helper module](https://github.com/phillipbaird/eventsourcing_book/blob/main/src/domain/helpers/stateless.rs) for more details.

A little bit of infrastructure needed to be built to listen to the required Kafka topic. That infrastructure can be found in [`/src/subsystems/kafka_listeners.rs`](https://github.com/phillipbaird/eventsourcing_book/blob/main/src/subsystems/kafka_listeners.rs). The only relevant thing to mention here is it records what messages have already been processed to ensures that messages do not get reprocessed.

### Chapter 25 - Inventories

The Inventories slice is implemented in `/src/domain/cart/inventories.rs`. The InventoriesReadModelProjection is implemented as a Disintegrate EventListener listening to the InventoryStream.

In this implementation we are not using an ORM but using SQL to a Postgresql database.
Note we track the last event processed in the read model. This is because Disintegrate Event Listeners are "at least once". Therefore our projections are responsible for ensuring they do not reprocess events they have already seen.

This chapter introduces our [first integration test](https://github.com/phillipbaird/eventsourcing_book/blob/main/tests/cart/inventories.rs). This integration test starts the server using a test database. It then sends a message to Kafka, which then forwards it to our server. This results in a command being processed and eventually the inventories read model is updated. Our test simply waits for the read model to be updated to the expected value.

### Chapter 26 - Implementing Automations

The "Eventual Consistency" section on page 411 discusses the problem of eventual consistency when archiving items.
"Make it immediately consistent" (starting on page 413) is the solution selected in the book.
The event sourcing crate we are using, Disintegrate, does not support immediately consistent read models so another solution was required.

The first step was to remove the race condition. We want the PriceChanged events to only archive items that should be archived. We do not want PriceChanged events to cause the archiving of items until we are certain all AddItem events that came before the PriceChanged event have been processed by the CartsWithProducts read model. Otherwise there is potential for an item that should have been archived to be missed. Likewise any AddItem events that came after the PriceChanged event should not be archived.

This implementation is not tied to the concept of aggregates. Event listeners can listen to events from any stream, part of a stream, or combination of streams. Our solution in this case is for the CartsWithProducts read model projection to process events from the union of the Cart stream and Pricing stream. This has the effect of serialising the events so that a PriceChanged event is always guaranteed to be handled after all the AddItem events that came before it. Likewise any AddItem events that came after the PriceChanged event will not be archived as the CartsWithProducts read model remains static while items are are being archived.

This approach does have a compromise. We now have a projection/read-model implementation that triggers commands, ArchiveItemCommands to be specific. This will be a problem if this read-model ever needs to be rebuilt via the projection because we will not want those commands to be re-executed. This is discussed in chapter 28. To avoid this situation in this implementation the ArchiveItemCommand has been made idempotent. This has been done by using the event id of the triggering PriceChanged event. The event handler for the PriceChanged event passes its event id to the ArchiveItemCommand.  The processing of the ArchiveItemCommand can then use this to determine if the command has already been processed. If so, no ItemArchived event is returned so effectively the command becomes a no-op.

### Chapter 27 - Submitting the Cart

> The book does not discuss how a cart should behaviour after it has been submitted?  Based on the fact that you cannot submit a cart a second time, I've assumed the cart should become immutable. We should not be able to add and remove items from a submitted cart and price changes should not result in items being archived from submitted carts. So in this implementation you will find additional validation to prevent modifying submitted carts.

#### Publishing the Cart

Publishing a cart requires sending a message to Kafka. This requires us to work with an external system so there is potential for availability problems and other failures. It is not ideal for event handlers to get blocked by potentially long running processors, so I decided to enable processors to be triggered by an event but run in the background.

To do this a work queue was implemented inspired by this [blog post](https://kerkour.com/rust-job-queue-with-postgresql) by Sylvain Kerkour. A Postgreql table stores tasks to be completed in the background. Batches of tasks are picked up from the queue and run concurrently. Individual tasks can be configured to retry on failure up to a certain number of times or for a maximum amount of time with exponential backoff.

In this case, instead of an event listener doing the publishing, the event listener places the Publish Cart Processor into the work queue.  It is given up to 1 hour to succeed (maybe Kafka's down for some reason?). With this implementation either the processor or the work queue can be responsible for recording an event on success or failure. For this particular processor, the success event is recorded by the processor itself and is done as part of a Kafka transaction. If a failure event needs to be recorded this is managed by the work queue.

### Chapter 28 - Breaking Changes

The Disintegrate crate that provides our event store does not have any built-in functionality to upcast events.
However the Serde crate which we use for JSON serialisation, can accommodate certain changes when an event is deserialised. For the new fingerprint field I've used the ability to provide a default value via a function call. This takes the form of an [field attribute](https://github.com/phillipbaird/eventsourcing_book/blob/main/src/domain/cart/clear_cart.rs) that identifies the function that provides the default value.

Unlike the Axon implementation the old and new versions of the event are not separate. This makes creating a similar upcasting test to that shown in this chapter as rather infeasible. The best we could do is test a JSON value for the old event properly deserialises with the new field. In effect recreating testing already done by the Serde crate. In this case all we need to do is be certain the function providing the default value, returns the correct value. The rest should take care of itself.

#### Replaying Projections

Chapter 28 introduces a modified version of the CartItems read model which is stored in the database. The previous version of the CartItems read model was a live projection from events. This implementation differs slightly is a few ways. Firstly, rather than maintain multiple branches of the code, I've simply added [another slice](https://github.com/phillipbaird/eventsourcing_book/blob/main/src/domain/cart/cart_items_from_db.rs) to the code so that both versions of the read model are available in the same code base. Secondly, the data returned by both versions of the read model have the same structure (see the [CartItemsReadModel struct](https://github.com/phillipbaird/eventsourcing_book/blob/befd64cb2577deb3ce3a708d3128a0c38268caba/src/domain/cart/cart_items.rs#L22-L47)). My database read model introduces a Cart table that only contains the cart id. This is there purely to be able to identify an empty cart from a non-existing cart.

The final difference is the reset of the read model can be triggered by a startup flag on the server binary, i.e. `cart_server -r` or `cart_server --reset-cart-items` will trigger a reset of the read model as the server starts. This probably isn't how I'd do this in a real application but it served it's purpose here.

## Technical Notes

This project uses the [SQLx crate](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/blob/main/README.md) for working with the database. It is also using compile-time validation of SQL queries, so in order to compile this project you need to have a database available to compile against.

The project also requires a Kafka instance as this is required for running the integration tests.

To simplify starting up a development environment, there is an [`init_dev.sh` script](https://github.com/phillipbaird/eventsourcing_book/blob/main/init_dev.sh) and [`docker-compose.yml` file](https://github.com/phillipbaird/eventsourcing_book/blob/main/docker-compose.yml). Running the script will setup the database and Kafka containers required for the project. The script however requires the `psql`, `docker`, `docker-compose` and [`sqlx`](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/blob/main/sqlx-cli/README.md) commands to be available on your system.
